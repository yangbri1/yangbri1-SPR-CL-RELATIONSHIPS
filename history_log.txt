    Playing around with '@ManyToOne()' (many albums could be created by an artist) & 'OneToMany()'  (one album may have many songs) annotations. As well as connecting different DB tables together using '@JoinColumn()' annotation by their FOREIGN_KEY (PRIMARY_KEY in 'Album' DB) 'album_fk' identifier.
